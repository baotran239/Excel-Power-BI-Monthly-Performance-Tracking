## III. Design thinking approach
### Step 1. Empathize 
#### 5W-1H
| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---------------|----------|
| **Who will see the dashboard?** | Marketing Team |
| **If we have to choose only one stakeholder, who will it be?** | Marketing Team |
| **What problem will the dashboard help to solve?** | Monthly performance tracking dashboard: It will help the team to track the performance of the service based on the transaction data collected. |
| **Where and when will our stakeholders see the dashboard?** | In meetings, presentation sessions, or anywhere they have to make decisions. |
| **Why do we have to build the dashboard?** | Without the dashboard, the monthly tracking will be more complicated when the raw data are not structured, combined, and visualized. |
| **How will our stakeholders see the dashboard to solve their business objectives?** | The dashboard will provide the overall-to-detailed monthly performance for the team to adjust their strategies for the next months. |

#### Empathy Map
| **Category** | **Details** |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Thinking and Feeling** | They feel confused and find it hard to gain insights when looking at the raw data. They do not know whether their strategies are suitable or not. They think they can utilize transactional data to devise the right strategies. |
| **Seeing** | They see a massive and chaotic pool of raw data. |
| **Saying and Doing** | "I want to deep dive into the collected data to find the insights. I need to give data-driven decisions." They seek data analysis and visualization to support their decision-making process. |
| **Pains** | Insufficient data and information may lead to inefficient solutions and decisions. |
| **Gains** | Key insights, unmet needs, straight-to-the-point strategies, data-driven solutions. |

### Step 2. Dataset Understanding
| **Table Type** | **Details** |
|----------------|----------|
| **Fact Table** | Data Transaction |
| **Dim Table** | Data User Info, Data Commission, RFMTable |

### Step 3. Define Point of View
#### Northstar Metric
| **Question**                          | **Answers**                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What VALUE you want to measure?**    | **1. Customer**  <br> **2. Profit**  <br> **3. Order**                                                   |
| **WHEN the value DELIVERY SUCCESS?**   | When they reach their maximum value                                                                      |
| **WHY do you choose this metric?**     | 1. To divide customers into different groups based on their transaction behavior, combined with their demographics to tailor suitable strategies for each customer group  <br> 2. To track the company's health via business growth and profitability  <br> 3. To identify customer behavior and transaction trends |

#### Dimension Data Group
| **Define Point of View** | **Group 1** | **Group 2** | **Group 3** | **Group 4** | **Group 5** | **Group 6**            |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Dimension Data Group** | Time        | Location    | Age         | Gender      | Merchant    | Purchase Status        |
