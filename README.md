| **Seeing** | They see a massive and chaotic pool of raw data. |
| **Saying and Doing** | "I want to deep dive into the collected data to find the insights. I need to give data-driven decisions." They seek data analysis and visualization to support their decision-making process. |
| **Pains** | Insufficient data and information may lead to inefficient solutions and decisions. |
| **Gains** | Key insights, unmet needs, straight-to-the-point strategies, data-driven solutions. |
